          <strong>The People of Finland</strong>
          <br>
          <br>
          My Finland trip first took me to the city of Edinburgh, Scotland to visit my sister who was studying<br>
          there at the university of Edinburgh. Edinburgh has a population of a shade over 450,000 and a<br>
          population density of 4730 per square mile. It was a city founded prior to the 7th century AD, <br>
          so it is a city with a very rich history. The people there of course spoke english, so there wasn’t <br>
          much of a culture shock. However, I did notice the people were mostly very polite, and the culture<br>
          seemed to be more environmentally conscious than the United States. <br><br>
	        After 5 days of tourist stops in Edinburgh, I made my way to Helsinki, Finland. Helsinki has an urban<br>
          population of around 1.2 million people and a population density of 4,700 per square mile. With a <br>
          similar population density as Edinburgh, the city had the same feel of not being very crowded. Founded<br>
          in 1550, it is a relatively “newer” city as compared to Edinburgh. This makes it older than the<br>
          United States, however.<br><br>
	        I noticed the people of Helsinki were more quiet and reserved than people in the United States. If <br>
          you ask a Finn “How are you doing today?” out of the blue, they will stare at you like you are crazy.<br>
          Finnish people talk to each other when they have something utilitarian to say, such as “Has the bus come by yet?”.<br>
          Finnish people are also very proud of their country and if they have a chance, they will ask how you<br>
          enjoy their country. The Finnish people I spoke to were happy to hear how much I enjoyed the weather.<br><br>
	        The people in Helsinki, like the people in Edinburgh were definitely environmentally conscious. In Helsinki, <br>
          I saw many trees that had wooden boards surrounding their trunks to protect them in areas where there was<br>
          construction, something I don’t think you would see in the United States. There was also a very nice small<br>
          nature preserve on an island I visited where there were ducks and squirrels, and the Finnish people who were<br>
          there were very respectful of the animals space. I haven’t seen anything like that in the United States.

          <strong>Automation in Finland and the World</strong>
          <br>
          <br>
          Automation in the manufacturing sector is defined by the International Society of Automation as “the <br>
          creation and application of technology to monitor and control the production and delivery of products <br>
          and services.” In Finland, there is an ABB factory that uses robots and automation to build much of their<br>
          products. It is surprising to note that the cost for one of the robots they use is only around €40,000. <br>
          The robot can perform a task in about 40 seconds, what would take a human around 3 minutes. This increase <br>
          in production pays for the robot in about a year. The robot can essentially produce enough extra to pay <br>
          the salary of an engineer in the company.<br><br>
	        Automation is here to stay, and with the increase in automation, in my opinion that it is important for <br>
          cultures to adapt to this change in a smart way. With more robots doing jobs, less people will be required <br>
          to be a part of building a product. We must be careful that this change doesn’t lead to more social problems, <br>
          such as wealth inequality, which is already a major problem in the United States. In Finland, wealth inequality <br>
          is not as big of a problem, so this social issue may not be a problem for them going forward. I think that <br>
          automation in the manufacturing sector is capable of increasing the quality of life of a culture, just like all <br>
          technology, but only if it is used the right way.
